[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/romeomihalovics/wob.city/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/romeomihalovics/wob.city)


The application represents cities, with name and population attributes. People can be differentiated by gender [male or female], and also, if a person is under age, he/she will be considered as a kid. Every people has a name, height, weight, age attribute. Each city has (/ could have, if there were more cities) a control center to verify it's people's informations. 

People burn 350 kcal per minute and eat a random amount of a random food every 3 minutes that is available in the city to refill his/her energy levels. If he/she does not eat enough, and his/her energy levels reaches 0, he/she will die.

In the city, you will find foods. Foods are segregated to 4 categories, meat, dairy, grain, vegetables. Every food has details about itself, which are [by default smth/100g], protein, carbohydrate, fat. You can calculate the calories in a specific food with these details [by default /100g, but you could set it to what ever amount you like], or list all of them.
